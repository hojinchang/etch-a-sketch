# etch-a-sketch

## About
This is a browser webpage version of a cross between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. 

Hover your mouse over the sketchpad to begin drawing. 

Select your desired colour using the colour input.

If you're feeling cheeky, select the ```Rainbow Fill``` option to use random colours.
